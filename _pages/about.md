I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Meteorology](http://www.reading.ac.uk/met/) at the University of Reading, and a member of the [Space and Atmospheric Electricity](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-spate/) (SPATE) group. My current appointment is funded under NERC's Pushing the Frontiers programme, and is titled "Why have space weather forecasts not improved in over a decade?". This work is focussed on the use of solar wind data assimilation to improve space weather forecasts. 

## Recent news

**November 2024**: I attended European Space Weather Week, my third time at the conference, this year located in Coimbra, Portugal. I presented a poster, which can be found [here](/talks/2024-11-04-ESWW-poster). 

**September 2024**: I attended the UK Space Weather and Space Environment meeting in Sandy Park, Exeter. I was invited to give a talk on my recent work and also to chair a session. More information can be found [here](/talks/2024-09-11-UKSWSE).

**July 2024**: I attended my graduation. The weather was hot and sunny, which made the robes a bit warm!

**April 2024**: I passed my PhD viva! Massive thank you to my internal examiner Chris Scott and external examiner Manuela Temmer of the University of Graz. Huge thanks to my supervisors Matt Owens and Matt Lang. 

**February 2024**: I submitted my thesis and then started my postdoc the next day. It never stops! 

**November 2023**: I attended European Space Weather Week, located in Toulouse, France. Due to being deep in writing my thesis, I did not present any work at this conference. 

**October 2023**: I gave a 2-hour lecture to Masters students at UCL on Space Weather Hazards. 

**July 2023**: I gave a talk during the MIST Seminar PhD special about using solar wind data assimilation in an operational context. A recording of the talk can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxpRCiF9i9Q).
