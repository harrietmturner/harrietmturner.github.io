## Academic experience

**Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the University of Reading** -- *February 2024 to August 2025*

I was a postdoctoral research assistant at the University of Reading, funded by NERC under the 'Pushing the Frontiers' opportunity. The project was titled "Why have space weather forecasts not improved for over a decade?" and focussed on exploring the use of data assimilation in solar wind forecasting. 

**Placement at the Met Office** -- *June 2023*

The Met Office provided CASE sponsorship for my PhD. I completed a 3 week placement to get the data assimilation scheme running on the Met Office system.

* Experiencing the Weather field course demonstrating -- *October 2021*

**Organisation**

* Organiser of the Space and Atmospheric Electricity (SPATE) research group, arranging internal and external speakers and social events -- *January 2021 to April 2023*
* Organised departmental ball, raising Â£1500 for charity -- *May 2022*
* PhD cohort representative, reporting feedback to the board of directors -- *2020 to 2024* 

  
## Skills

**IT and computing**

* Proficient use of Python for data analysis and statistical methods.
* Experience with numerical modelling. 
* Attended software development training as part of my PhD.
* Adaptation of other users' code for use in my own work, such as working with the BRaVDA code.
* Integration of code with Git for version control and working on collaborative projects.
* Experience of batch computing on computing clusters. 

**Research and data**

* Experience with different data types, e.g. NetCDF, CDF, HDF5, CSV.
* Generation of forecast datasets from the data assimilation output.
* Extensive analysis and verification of the solar wind data assimilation forecast scheme.

**Presentation and publication**

* Numerous presentations of my own work to both specialist and non-specialist audiences.
* Scientific writing: three first-author publications and contributions to further co-author publications. 
* Non-scientific writing: numerous blog posts and short reports on my work, including contribution to the production of a press release about my work and writing an entry for the University of Reading's 'Research Highlights' publication.
* Reviewed a paper for the *Space Weather* journal. Partly due to my contribution, the verdict was 'reject and refer'.

## Selected conferences and presentations

**Poster at European Space Weather Week, Portugal** -- *November 2024*  
Presented a poster on the initial work undertaken during my postdoctoral research position. 

**Invited talk and chaired session at the UK Space Weather and Space Environment Meeting** -- *September 2024*
