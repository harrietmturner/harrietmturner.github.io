I presented my work online at the EGU General Assembly on 25<sup>th</sup> May 2022.

In this talk, I presented the work from my 2022 paper about how removing ICMEs and the age of observations affects the forecast accuracy of solar wind data assimilation.  

The slides can be found [here](slides/EGU_talk.pdf).
