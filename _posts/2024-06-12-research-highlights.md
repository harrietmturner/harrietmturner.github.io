I wrote a short article for the University of Reading's Doctoral Research Highlights 2023 publication, following on from the successful press release about my 2023 paper. 

I was approached to write an article for the publication, which is put together every year to highlight important and interesting research that occurs across the university. The publication can be found [here](https://www.reading.ac.uk/doctoral-researcher-college/-/media/project/uor-main/schools-departments/graduate-school/documents/b31287-graduate-school-research-highlights-2023-awv5---digitally-accessible.pdf).
