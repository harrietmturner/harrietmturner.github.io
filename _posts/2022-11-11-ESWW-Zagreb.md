This is a departmental blog post detailing my trip to European Space Weather Week (ESWW) in Zagreb, Croatia. 

This was my first international conference and the first time I had ever taken a flight, so I wrote a blog post for my departments PhD student blog. The post can be found [here](https://socialmetwork.blog/2022/11/11/european-space-weather-week-and-exploring-zagreb/).
